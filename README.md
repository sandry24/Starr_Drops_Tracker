# Starr Drops Stat Tracker
My first semi-serious data science project. This is based on the game "Brawl Stars" which has a daily reward names Starr Drops. Gathering the data of over 500 openings from me and my friends, this project implements dozens of functions to help analyze the range, odds and summary of all the rewards registered. Besides data science functions there are also numerous error checking algorithms to filter out wrong data.
